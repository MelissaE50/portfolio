    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      
      <img alt="Globe with maps" src="assets/images/webpage-image.jpg" /> The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>

    <p class="alert"> This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>

    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>

    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>

    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>

    <p>The "alt" attribute is to provide alternative text for images. This increases accessibility for users who might be vision impaired, using a screen reader, or the image doesn't load for some reason. The "title" attribute provides additional information about the element.</p>

    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to markup a definition from the dictionary.</h4>

    <p>Example: 
    <dl>
  <dt>Java</dt>
  <dd>A high-level, object-oriented programming language used for building applications.</dd>  
  <dt><dfn title="A high-level, object-oriented programming language">Java</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The programming language widely used for web, desktop, and mobile applications.</dd>
</dl>  
    </p>
