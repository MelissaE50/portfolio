        <h2>Writing Example 1</h2>
        <p>Legal Case Brief - In the summer of 2025, I took a Legal Environment of Business course. I've attached a legal brief I wrote concerning the <em>Herrera v. Wyoming</em> case. This example showcases my ability to read and analyze a Supreme Court decision and offer a coherent opinion on that decision.</p>

        <h2>Writing Example 2</h2>
        <p>Charity Proposal - In a college English course, the students were tasked with researching and writing a charity proposal. The professor indicated that he would choose the two best proposals and make a donation to those organizations in the authors' names. I wrote this proposal in support of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and it was one of the two chosen to receive a donation. This project highlights my ability to research a topic and craft a compelling proposal with a successful outcome.</p>
